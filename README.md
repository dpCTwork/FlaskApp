### About 

This is a basic budgeting app using Flask. The app frontend was made using jinja, Python, and Bootstrap 5, while the backend was made using Flask-SQLAlchemy and connected to a PostgreSQL database. The frontend is currently minimal, and will be revamped using React.

By creating this app, I was able to gain experience in the following:

- Modular programming using Flask and MVC architecture
- Database connections and building using Flask-SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- Flask Jinja templating and Python
- REST API development and CRUD operations
- API testing/debugging with Insomnia
- HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap5
